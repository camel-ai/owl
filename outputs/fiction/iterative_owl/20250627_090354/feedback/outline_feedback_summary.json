      "feedback": "The story outline has a clear and logical structure, with a well-defined setting and character introductions. The conflict and growth sections are also well-paced, with a clear escalation of tensions and a coherent narrative flow. However, the story may benefit from more nuance in character development and more specific details about the tech startup setting and the AI project.\n\nSuggestions:\nAdd more specific details about the tech startup setting, such as the company culture, the team's role within the company, and the specific challenges they face.\nDevelop the characters beyond their initial traits, such as Alexa's cynicism, Mia's optimism, and Sasha's ambition. Consider adding character backstories or motivations to make them more relatable and nuanced.\nConsider adding more tension or conflict to the story, such as external pressures from competitors or investors, or internal conflicts between the sisters' different priorities and values.\nShow, don't tell, when it comes to character traits and project details. Instead of telling the reader about the sisters' personalities or the project's goals, demonstrate these through action, dialogue, and scene description.",
