The message is straightforward but does not help the user understand what to do next or why the error occurred. It seems to be a technical notification rather than a user-friendly message.\n\nSuggestions:\nProvide a Clear Solution or Next Steps: Enhance the message by including a suggestion on how to resolve the issue, such as \"Please set your API key in the client configuration or ensure the GROQ_API_KEY environment variable is correctly set.\"\nOffer Additional Context: Consider adding a brief explanation of why the api_key is necessary and how it enhances security or functionality.",
