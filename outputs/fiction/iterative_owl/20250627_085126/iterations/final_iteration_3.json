  "feedback": "The content provides clear instructions on how to resolve the API key error, which is helpful. However, it lacks a friendly tone and concise language, making it seem more like a technical manual than a user-friendly guide. The structure is straightforward but could benefit from a brief summary or example to make it more memorable.\n\nSuggestions:\nAdd a brief introductory sentence to set the context and make the content more approachable.\nConsider providing an example of how to pass the API key to the client to make the instructions more concrete.",
