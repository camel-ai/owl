**Physical Description:** Humpty Dumpty is an anthropomorphic egg with a well-chiseled, athletic build. His radiant, smooth shell glistens under the club lights, reflecting shades of ivory and cream. The scent of his expensive cologne wafts through the air, a subtle blend of citrus and spices that leaves a lasting impression. As he moves, the soft rustle of his tailored suits and the gentle tickle of his cufflinks against his wrists create a soothing melody.

The sound of his laughter is deep and rich, a warm, throaty sound that puts those around him at ease.

He began performing in various clubs, the thrum of the music and the roar of the crowd igniting a fire within him. He eventually opened "The Cracked Egg," which quickly became a sensation.
