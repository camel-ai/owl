## AABB Rhyme

Here's a possible AABB rhyme to echo Humpty Dumpty:

In the underworld, where shadows play,
Humpty Dumpty ruled with an iron way.
His empire vast, his power so grand,
But Miss Muffet's heart was icy cold in hand.

She plotted against him, with a wicked grin,
And brought him down, with a fatal spin.
His fall was great, his empire lost,
And all his men, couldn't put him to the cost.

His legacy remains, a cautionary tale,
Of power and corruption, and a love that failed.
Miss Muffet's heart, still icy cold as stone,
Remains the reason, for Humpty's downfall alone.
