The `calculate_fibonacci` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth term.\n2. It handles edge cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0, 1, or 2.\n3. For `n` greater than 2, it initializes a list `fib_sequence` with the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1) and then appends subsequent numbers using a loop.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the number of terms, calls `calculate_fibonacci`, and prints the resulting Fibonacci numbers.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Save this script to a file named `fibonacci.py`.\n2. Run the script using Python (e.g., `python fibonacci.py`).\n3. When prompted, enter the desired number of terms (e.g., 10).\n4. The script will output the Fibonacci numbers up to the specified term.\n\n### Writing to File\n\nTo save the Fibonacci numbers to a file, you can modify the `main` function to use the `write_to_file` tool:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    num_terms = int(input(\"Enter the number of terms: \"))\n    fib_numbers = calculate_fibonacci(num_terms)\n    print(f\"Fibonacci numbers up to {num_terms} terms: {fib_numbers}\")\n\n    filename = \"fibonacci_output.txt\"\n    content = f\"Fibonacci numbers up to {num_terms} terms: {fib_numbers}\"\n    {\"name\": \"write_to_file\", \"parameters\": {\"content\": content, \"filename\": filename, \"encoding\": \"utf-8\"}}\n```\n\nNext request.",

        "assistant": "Solution:\n## Review of Fibonacci Calculator Script\n\nThe provided Python script calculates Fibonacci numbers up to a given number of terms. Here's a review of the script with areas for improvement:\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. **Clear Functionality**: The script clearly calculates Fibonacci numbers up to a given number of terms.\n2. **Well-structured Code**: The code is well-organized, with a separate function for calculating Fibonacci numbers and a `main` function for user interaction.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **User Input Validation**: The script does not validate user input. If the user enters a non-integer or a negative number, the script will fail or produce incorrect results.\n2. **Error Handling**: The script lacks error handling mechanisms. It does not handle potential exceptions that may occur during execution.\n3. **Documentation**: While the code has some docstrings, it could benefit from more detailed documentation, including information about the function's parameters, return values, and potential exceptions.\n4. **Type Hints**: The function parameters and return types could be annotated with type hints to improve code readability and facilitate static type checking.\n5. **Performance**: For large values of `n`, the script's performance could be improved by using a more efficient algorithm, such as memoization or matrix exponentiation.\n\n### Suggestions\n\n1. **Add Input Validation**: Validate user input to ensure it is a positive integer.\n2. **Implement Error Handling**: Catch and handle potential exceptions that may occur during execution.\n3. **Enhance Documentation**: Add more detailed docstrings and consider using a documentation generator like Sphinx.\n4. **Add Type Hints**: Annotate function parameters and return types with type hints.\n5. **Consider Performance Optimizations**: Explore more efficient algorithms for calculating Fibonacci numbers.\n\n### Updated Code\n\nHere's an updated version of the script that addresses some of these areas for improvement:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_fibonacci(n: int) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate Fibonacci numbers up to the nth term.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n    list[int]: A list of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth term.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If n is not a positive integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a positive integer\")\n\n    if n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n\n    fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n    while len(fib_sequence) < n:\n        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n\n    return fib_sequence\n\n\ndef main() -> None:\n    try:\n        num_terms = int(input(\"Enter the number of terms: \"))\n        fib_numbers = calculate_fibonacci(num_terms)\n        print(f\"Fibonacci numbers up to {num_terms} terms: {fib_numbers}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nNext request.",

The test suite consists of five test cases:\n\t* `test_edge_cases`: Tests the function's behavior for edge cases (n = 0, 1, 2).\n\t* `test_small_values`: Tests the function's behavior for small values of n (n = 3, 4, 5).\n\t* `test_large_values`: Tests the function's behavior for larger values of n (n = 8).\n\t* `test_invalid_input`: Tests the function's behavior for invalid input (non-integer, negative integer, non-numeric).\n\t* `test_type_hints`: Tests the function's type hints.\n2. Each test case uses the `assertEqual` method to verify that the function's output matches the expected output.\n3. The `test_invalid_input` case uses the `assertRaises` method to verify that the function raises a `ValueError` for invalid input.\n\n### Running the Tests\n\n1. Save the test suite to a file named `test_fibonacci.py`.\n2. Run the tests using the command `python -m unittest test_fibonacci`.\n\n### Updating the Fibonacci Calculator Script\n\nTo make the Fibonacci calculator script more robust, you can update it to handle invalid input and provide more informative error messages:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_fibonacci(n: int) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate Fibonacci numbers up to the nth term.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n    list[int]: A list of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth term.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If n is not a positive integer.\n    TypeError: If n is not an integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int):\n        raise TypeError(\"n must be an integer\")\n    if n <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a positive integer\")\n\n    # ...

        "assistant": "Solution:\n## Refactored Fibonacci Calculator Script using Memoization\n\nThe following refactored script uses memoization to calculate Fibonacci numbers more efficiently for large values of n.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_fibonacci(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the nth Fibonacci number using memoization.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The term number in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The nth Fibonacci number.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If n is not a positive integer.\n    TypeError: If n is not an integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int):\n        raise TypeError(\"n must be an integer\")\n    if n <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a positive integer\")\n\n    memo = {0: 0, 1: 1}\n\n    def fib(n):\n        if n not in memo:\n            memo[n] = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)\n        return memo[n]\n\n    return fib(n)\n\n\ndef calculate_fibonacci_sequence(n: int) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term using memoization.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n    list[int]: A list of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth term.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If n is not a positive integer.\n    TypeError: If n is not an integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int):\n        raise TypeError(\"n must be an integer\")\n    if n <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a positive integer\")\n\n    return [calculate_fibonacci(i) for i in range(n)]\n\n\ndef main() -> None:\n    try:\n        num_terms = int(input(\"Enter the number of terms: \"))\n        fib_sequence = calculate_fibonacci_sequence(num_terms)\n        print(f\"Fibonacci numbers up to {num_terms} terms: {fib_sequence}\")\n    except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_fibonacci` function uses memoization to store previously calculated Fibonacci numbers in a dictionary `memo`.\n2. The `fib` function is a recursive helper function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using memoization.\n3. The `calculate_fibonacci_sequence` function calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term by calling `calculate_fibonacci` for each term.\n\n### Matrix Exponentiation Alternative\n\nFor even larger values of n, matrix exponentiation can be used to calculate Fibonacci numbers more efficiently. Here's an example implementation:\n\n```python\ndef matrix_multiply(a: list[list[int]], b: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    result = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            for k in range(2):\n                result[i][j] += a[i][k] * b[k][j]\n    return result\n\n\ndef matrix_power(matrix: list[list[int]], n: int) -> list[list[int]]:\n    if n == 1:\n        return matrix\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        half_pow = matrix_power(matrix, n // 2)\n        return matrix_multiply(half_pow, half_pow)\n    else:\n        half_pow = matrix_power(matrix, n // 2)\n        return matrix_multiply(matrix_multiply(half_pow, half_pow), matrix)\n\n\ndef calculate_fibonacci(n: int) -> int:\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n    fib_matrix = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]\n    result_matrix = matrix_power(fib_matrix, n - 1)\n    return result_matrix[0][0]\n```\n\nThis implementation uses matrix exponentiation to calculate the nth Fibonacci number in O(log n) time complexity.\n\nNext request.",
