For this task, let's call it \"fibonacci_task_<timestamp>\".\n\nHowever, as I'm a text-based AI model, I don't have direct access to the file system or the ability to execute shell commands. But I can guide you through the process or provide a Python code snippet to achieve this.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet to create a new directory and navigate into it:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef create_and_navigate_directory(dir_name):\n    try:\n        # Create the directory\n        os.mkdir(dir_name)\n        print(f\"Directory '{dir_name}' created successfully.\")\n        \n        # Navigate into the directory\n        os.chdir(dir_name)\n        print(f\"Navigated into directory '{dir_name}'.\")\n        \n    except FileExistsError:\n        print(f\"Directory '{dir_name}' already exists.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n# Example usage\ntimestamp = \"2023-12-01_14-30\"\ndir_name = f\"fibonacci_task_{timestamp}\"\ncreate_and_navigate_directory(dir_name)\n```\n\nTo actually create and navigate into the directory, you would run this script. \n\nIf you want me to proceed with the task within this newly created directory, please provide the next instruction.\n\nNext request.",
