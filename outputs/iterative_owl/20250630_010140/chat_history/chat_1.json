Then, I'll navigate into the newly created directory.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Create a new directory with a descriptive name and timestamp\ntimestamp = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\")\ndir_name = f\"task_output_{timestamp}\"\nos.mkdir(dir_name)\n\n# Navigate into the newly created directory\nos.chdir(dir_name)\n\nprint(f\"Created directory: {dir_name}\")\nprint(f\"Current working directory: {os.getcwd()}\")\n```\n\nHowever, since I don't have the capability to execute system commands or access the file system directly, I'll provide a descriptive solution.\n\nLet's assume the task output directory is created and navigated successfully. The directory name will be used as a reference for future output file creations.\n\nNext request.",
