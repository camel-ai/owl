  "task": "Here's a well-structured and comprehensive **prompt** you can use to guide an **OWL (Observation, Wondering, Learning)** agent or any advanced AI research agent in exploring the best ways to build **creative writing and editing agents** within a **multi-agent architecture**:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Prompt: Build a Creative Writing Agent Ecosystem\n\n**Objective:**  \nDesign a multi-agent system where one specialized agent focuses on **creative writing** and another on **editing**, detailing tools, dependencies, best practices, and integration strategies.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Observation\nI want to create a multi-agent construct that includes two distinct but interconnected specialists:\n1. A **Creative Writing Agent** focused solely on generating original, imaginative, and stylistically rich content.\n2. An **Editing & Refinement Agent** responsible for reviewing, revising, and polishing the output of the writing agent.\n\nI need guidance on how to structure these agents from scratch, including:\n- Tools, frameworks, and libraries to use\n- Best practices for prompt engineering, memory handling, and feedback loops\n- How to manage dependencies between agents\n- Strategies for version control, collaboration, and scalability\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd14 Wondering\nCan you provide a detailed roadmap for building this dual-agent system? Specifically, I\u2019d like to know:\n\n#### For the Creative Writing Agent:\n- What LLMs are best suited for creative generation (e.g., storywriting, poetry, dialogue)?\n- Which tools or frameworks help with storytelling logic, world-building, character consistency?\n- How to implement creativity controls (tone, genre, mood)?\n- Should it have memory modules or knowledge bases for continuity?\n\n#### For the Editing Agent:\n- What models or tools excel at grammar checking, tone adjustment, clarity improvement?\n- How to integrate style guides, voice consistency checks, and readability metrics?\n- Can it provide iterative feedback or suggest alternative phrasings?\n- How to handle long-form content and maintain coherence across edits?\n\n#### For Multi-Agent Architecture:\n- What platforms support agent-to-agent communication (e.g., CrewAI, AutoGPT, LangChain, LlamaIndex)?\n- How should the agents coordinate \u2014 synchronous vs asynchronous workflows?\n- What patterns exist for task delegation, feedback loops, and final output synthesis?\n- How to ensure modularity so each agent can evolve independently?\n\n#### Dependencies & Best Practices:\n- What are the core dependencies (Python packages, APIs, databases)?\n- How to version control prompts, outputs, and agent behaviors?\n- How to evaluate agent performance \u2014 automated metrics or human-in-the-loop?\n- What ethical considerations should be addressed (e.g., plagiarism, bias)?\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcda Learning Outcomes\nI expect a structured report covering:\n1. Agent roles and responsibilities\n2. Recommended tech stack and architecture diagram\n3. Implementation steps and sample code snippets (if applicable)\n4. Integration strategies and workflow examples\n5. Best practices for training, evaluation, and maintenance\n\nPlease include references to open-source tools, papers, or existing projects that demonstrate similar systems.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like this as a template for automation, or tailored for a specific platform like **LangGraph**, **CrewAI**, or **Autogen**.",
